============

Name TBC.

Experimental bukkit mod/plugin, modifies Minecraft.

Compatability: Java 7+, Bukkit 1.8 (created against 1.8, 1.8.3 and 1.8.8)

**YOU SHOULD ALWAYS RESTART YOUR SERVER (NO /RELOAD) WITH THIS PLUGIN INSTALLED OTHERWISE THINGS MAY NOT WORK AS EXPECTED**

Changes:

### Zombie

- walk slower
- when agroed move faster
- leap at target
- dont need sight to agro
- longer agro range
- don't attack villagers
- immune to fire
- 4 base damage instead of 3
- 30 health instead of 20

### Skeleton

- wither skeletons spawn at 30% chance, use a bow (flame arrows automatically)
- shoot double speed at max range (regular speed at close range)
- more accurate (still crappy at max range, basically never hit)
- longer attack + agro range

### Spider

- Attack no matter the light level
- Explodes webs (as falling sand entities) and shows blood particles on death
- 50% base movement speed buff, makes about the same speed as a sprint jumping player on flat land

### Sheep

- Float around like derpy clouds, because why not

### Chicken

- Ranged mob that shoot eggs that do damage (half heart base)
- Chance for eggs to spawn babies is a flat 1/32 chance and only 1 can spawn

### Creeper

- Explodes a short time after it's death (even if it died by exploding, gives particle effect warning)

### Rabbit

- 1% chance to spawn as a killer rabbit

## Known problems

Zombies riding chickens *shouldnt* work, as well as Skeleton jockeys. Any invalid non-custom mobs spawned are cancelled
meaning there will be no invalid invisible mobs walking around.
